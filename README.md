Cybercrime refers to illegal activities that are carried out using computers, digital devices, or the internet. As our lives become increasingly connected through technology, cybercriminals have found new ways to exploit systems, steal data, and disrupt services. From identity theft and phishing scams to large-scale ransomware attacks and breaches of national security, cybercrime is a rapidly growing threat that affects individuals, businesses, and governments alike.

This project/paper explores the different types of cybercrime, its causes, major real-world incidents, and the legal and technological measures being taken to combat it. Understanding cybercrime is essential for building awareness and developing strategies to stay protected in the digital age.
